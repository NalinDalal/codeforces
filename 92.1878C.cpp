C. Vasilije in Cacak
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Aca and Milovan, two fellow competitive programmers, decided to give Vasilije a
problem to test his skills.

Vasilije is given three positive integers: 𝑛, 𝑘, and 𝑥, and he has to determine
if he can choose 𝑘 distinct integers between 1 and 𝑛, such that their sum is
equal to 𝑥.

Since Vasilije is now in the weirdest city in Serbia where Aca and Milovan live,
Cacak, the problem seems weird to him. So he needs your help with this problem.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three integers 𝑛, 𝑘 and 𝑥 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅105,
1≤𝑘≤𝑛, 1≤𝑥≤4⋅1010) — the maximum element he can choose, the number of elements
he can choose and the sum he has to reach.

Note that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases may exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case output one line: "YES", if it is possible to choose 𝑘
distinct integers between 1 and 𝑛, such that their sum is equal to 𝑥, and "NO",
if it isn't.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note
In the first test case 𝑛=5, 𝑘=3, 𝑥=10, so we can choose the numbers: 2, 3, 5,
whose sum is 10, so the answer is "YES".

In the second test case 𝑛=5, 𝑘=3, 𝑥=3, there is no three numbers which satisfies
the condition, so the answer is "NO". It can be shown that there are no three
numbers whose sum is 3.
