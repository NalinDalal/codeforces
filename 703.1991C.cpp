You are given an array ùëé
 of ùëõ
 integers.

In one operation, you will perform the following two-step move:

Choose an integer ùë•
 (0‚â§ùë•‚â§109
).
Replace each ùëéùëñ
 with |ùëéùëñ‚àíùë•|
, where |ùë£|
 denotes the absolute value of ùë£
.
For example, by choosing ùë•=8
, the array [5,7,10]
 will be changed into [|5‚àí8|,|7‚àí8|,|10‚àí8|]=[3,1,2]
.

Construct a sequence of operations to make all elements of ùëé
 equal to 0
 in at most 40
 operations or determine that it is impossible. You do not need to minimize the
number of operations.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
ùë° (1‚â§ùë°‚â§104 ) ‚Äî the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer ùëõ
 (1‚â§ùëõ‚â§2‚ãÖ105
) ‚Äî the length of the array ùëé
.

The second line of each test case contains ùëõ
 integers ùëé1,ùëé2,‚Ä¶,ùëéùëõ
 (0‚â§ùëéùëñ‚â§109
) ‚Äî the elements of the array ùëé
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of ùëõ
 over all test cases does not exceed 2‚ãÖ105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer ‚àí1
 if it is impossible to make all array elements equal to 0
 in at most 40
 operations.

Otherwise, output two lines. The first line of output should contain a single
integer ùëò (0‚â§ùëò‚â§40 ) ‚Äî the number of operations. The second line of output should
contain ùëò integers ùë•1,ùë•2,‚Ä¶,ùë•ùëò (0‚â§ùë•ùëñ‚â§109 ) ‚Äî the sequence of operations, denoting
that on the ùëñ -th operation, you chose ùë•=ùë•ùëñ
.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Note
In the first test case, we can perform only one operation by choosing ùë•=5
, changing the array from [5]
 to [0]
.

In the second test case, no operations are needed because all elements of the
array are already 0
.

In the third test case, we can choose ùë•=6
 to change the array from [4,6,8]
 to [2,0,2]
, then choose ùë•=1
 to change it to [1,1,1]
, and finally choose ùë•=1
 again to change the array into [0,0,0]
.

In the fourth test case, we can make all elements 0
 by following the operation sequence (60,40,20,10,30,25,5)
.

In the fifth test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to make all
elements 0 in at most 40 operations. Therefore, the output is ‚àí1
.

/*(t--){

 int ans=0;

vector<int> ansVec(n);
logic for ans and ansVec

In one operation, you will perform the following two-step move:

Choose an integer x (0‚â§x‚â§109).
Replace each ai with |ai‚àíx|, where |a| denotes the absolute value of v.
For example, by choosing ùë•=8, the array [5,7,10] will be changed into
[|5‚àí8|,|7‚àí8|,|10‚àí8|]=[3,1,2].

Construct a sequence of operations to make all elements of a equal to 0 in at
most 40 operations or determine that it is impossible. You do not need to
minimize the number of operations.

Track whether the array contains odd numbers, even numbers, or both:

odd = true if any element is odd

even = true if any element is even

if(odd && even)cout<<-1<<endl;

 if(ans>40)cout<<-1<<endl;
 else{
 cout<<ans<<endl;
 for(int i=0;i<n;i++)cout<<ansVec[i]<<" ";
 }
 cout<<endl;
}

for each test case:
    read n
    read array a[0..n-1]

    odd = false
    even = false
    for each element in a:
        if element is odd:
            odd = true
        else:
            even = true

    if odd and even:
        output -1
        continue to next test case

    output 30 + (1 if even else 0)  // number of operations

    for i from 29 down to 0:
        output 2^i

    if even:
        output 1
