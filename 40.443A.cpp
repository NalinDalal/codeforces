A. Anton and Letters
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters.
Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated by
a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the line
and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line.

Unfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and
write it again. He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his
set.

Input
The first and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the
line doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening
curved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. Between them, small
English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a
space.

Output
Print a single number â€” the number of distinct letters in Anton's set.
