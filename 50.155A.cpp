Vasya adores sport programming. He can't write programs but he loves to watch
the contests' progress. Vasya even has a favorite coder and Vasya pays special
attention to him.

One day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite
coder participated and track the progress of his coolness. For each contest
where this coder participated, he wrote out a single non-negative number — the
number of points his favorite coder earned in the contest. Vasya wrote out the
points for the contest in the order, in which the contests run (naturally, no
two contests ran simultaneously).

Vasya considers a coder's performance in a contest amazing in two situations: he
can break either his best or his worst performance record. First, it is amazing
if during the contest the coder earns strictly more points that he earned on
each past contest. Second, it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns
strictly less points that he earned on each past contest. A coder's first
contest isn't considered amazing. Now he wants to count the number of amazing
performances the coder had throughout his whole history of participating in
contests. But the list of earned points turned out long and Vasya can't code...
That's why he asks you to help him.

Input
The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of
contests where the coder participated.

The next line contains n space-separated non-negative integer numbers — they are
the points which the coder has earned. The points are given in the chronological
order. All points do not exceed 10000.

Output
Print the single number — the number of amazing performances the coder has had
during his whole history of participating in the contests.
