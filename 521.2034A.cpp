/*A. King Keykhosrow's Mystery
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
There is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand treasury filled
with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However, to prevent theft and
ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a
magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle.


The riddle involves two sacred numbers 𝑎
 and 𝑏
. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number 𝑚
 that satisfies two conditions:

𝑚
 must be greater than or equal to at least one of 𝑎
 and 𝑏
.
The remainder when 𝑚
 is divided by 𝑎
 must be equal to the remainder when 𝑚
 is divided by 𝑏
.
Only by finding the smallest correct value of 𝑚
 can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤100
), the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers 𝑎
 and 𝑏
 (1≤𝑎,𝑏≤1000
).

Output
For each test case, print the smallest integer 𝑚
 that satisfies the conditions above.

4 6
472 896
OutputCopy
12
52864
Note
In the first test case, you can see that:

4mod4=0
 but 4mod6=4
5mod4=1
 but 5mod6=5
6mod4=2
 but 6mod6=0
7mod4=3
 but 7mod6=1
8mod4=0
 but 8mod6=2
9mod4=1
 but 9mod6=3
10mod4=2
 but 10mod6=4
11mod4=3
 but 11mod6=5
so no integer less than 12
 satisfies the desired properties.
