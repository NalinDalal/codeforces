Luke likes to eat. There are 𝑛
 piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The 𝑖
-th pile contains 𝑎𝑖
 units of food.

Luke will walk from the 1
-st pile towards the 𝑛
-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke
reaches the 𝑖 -th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if |𝑣−𝑎𝑖|≤𝑥 , where 𝑥
 is a fixed integer, and 𝑣
 is Luke's food affinity.

Before Luke starts to walk, he can set 𝑣
 to any integer. Also, for each 𝑖
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛
), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the 𝑖
-th pile.

Find the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food.

Note that the initial choice for 𝑣
 is not considered as a change.

Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104 ) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases
follows.

For each test case, the first line contains two integers, 𝑛,𝑥
 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅105
, 1≤𝑥≤109
) — the number of piles, and the maximum difference between the size of a pile
and Luke's food affinity, such that Luke can eat the pile.

The second line contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤109
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output an integer on a separate line, which is the minimum
number of changes needed.

Note
In the first test case, Luke can set 𝑣
 to 5
 before he starts to walk. And he can walk straight to eat every piles of food
without changing 𝑣
.

In the second test case, Luke can set 𝑣
 to 3
 before he starts to walk. And he could change 𝑣
 to 10
 before he eats the second pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat
remaining food without changing 𝑣
.

In the fourth test case, Luke can set 𝑣
 to 3
 before he starts to walk. And he could change 𝑣
 to 8
 before he eats the sixth pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat
remaining food without changing 𝑣
.

In the fifth test case, Luke can set 𝑣
 to 4
 before he starts to walk. And he could change 𝑣
 to 6
 before he eats the fourth pile. Then he could change 𝑣
 to 12
 before he eats the seventh pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat
remaining food without changing 𝑣
.
